<h6> Instructions to Run TagChecker </h6>

To run TagChecker, please clone this repo into your local machine.
You do not need any external libraries as I have used builtin libraries like re and collections.

After which, please modify or replace Paragraph.txt with your Sample and run TagChecker.py. You can do so by
1. running py TagChecker.py through the CLI - Recommended
2. running TagChecker.py on your favourite IDE
