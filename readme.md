## How to Run TagChecker

<h6>To run TagChecker, please clone this repo into your local machine.
You do not need any external libraries as I have used builtin libraries like re and collections.

After which, please modify or replace Paragraph.txt with your Sample and run TagChecker.py. You can do so by
1. running through the CLI - <b>Recommended</b>

windows
```python
py TagChecker.py 
```
linux
```python
python3 TagChecker.py 
```

2. running on your favourite IDE
```python 
py TagChecker.py
```

Please feel free to go through the <b>commmit history</b> to explore my thought process and how I solved
this given task.

Note 1: I have also included Test.py that was seperated from TagChecker.py for easy testing, and made it modular with HelperFunctions.py
Note 2: Development was done in python 3.12 but any version above 3.9 will run the program
